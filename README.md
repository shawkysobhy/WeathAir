- [ ] previous version **Air Quality** api provide historical data and forecast of weather and population with get city end point i see it in docs but in current version in postman provide only **current values** only with paid version i think,

- [ ] Unfortunately, the map of weather i suffers, and after searching,but I think i found soluation with useing leaflet map nad openweather map api to make this feature ,and due to time constraints, i haven't complete, and i hope you take that into consideration."

- [ ] app crashed cause of limitation of free api so take this in consideration (too many request )
