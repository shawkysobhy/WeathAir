- [ ] previous version **Air Quality** api provide historical data and forecast of weather and population with get city end point i see it in docs but in current version in supabebase provide only **current values** only with paid version i think

- [ ] Unfortunately, the map of weather i suffers, and after searching, I found a map that exactly what I required from task from openWeather Map, but I faced problems in using it and also for delivery on the agreed upon time
- [ ] app crashed cause of limitation of free api so take this in consideration
